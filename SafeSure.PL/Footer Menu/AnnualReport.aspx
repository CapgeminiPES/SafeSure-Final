        <h3>From planning to execution<br /></h3>
The strength of our determination to focus on
customers is now different from anything
I have seen previously at Zurich. One example
is the work of our outstanding Group
Strategy Task Force. Building on its contribution
to Zurich’s Strategy, in 2017 the Task Force
worked with our Executive Committee to
develop Zurich’s purpose and values. These
let customers know, in a clear and simple way,
why we are relevant to their lives and how
we deliver on that relevance.
2017 also saw Zurich complete a number of
acquisitions. These will expand our service
offering across an even broader range of
segments. They include the planned
purchase of ANZ’s Australian life insurance arm
OnePath Life, pending regulatory approval.
This will see Zurich become the largest retail life
insurer in Australia, protecting 1.5 million
Australians, while retaining our focus on
capital-light protection and unit-linked
business. It includes a 20-year distribution
agreement with ANZ in Australia to
distribute life insurance products through
its bank channels.
We also purchased leading travel insurance
services and assistance provider Cover-More.
This makes Zurich the third-largest global travel
insurance provider. Cover-More’s clear customer
focus makes it an ideal addition. Just as one
example, they were the only travel insurance
provider to send a team and aircraft to Nepal
to help rescue earthquake survivors in 2015.
And as digitalization transforms our value
chain and customer expectations, Zurich
is responding to the challenge. This includes
acquisitions such as Bright Box, a global
telematics solutions provider. We are also
establishing a new business that will
focus on developing state-of-the-art mobile
insurance solutions across our Group.
Our actions come alongside strong financial
performance and we remain on course
to meet strategic targets. There has been
progress in the Property & Casualty, Life
and Farmers businesses coming alongside
resilience to the natural catastrophes
witnessed in the third quarter. Reflecting the
Group’s strong performance in 2017, and
with expectations of further improvement in
2018, the Board is proposing to increase
the dividend to 18 CHF per share. In addition,
in line with our policy on anti-dilution,
we intend buy back shares in the amount of
about USD 1 billion.<br />
<h3>Delivering sustainably</h3>
Our customers expect us to deliver sustainably.
Zurich’s continued corporate responsibility
focus ensures we meet these expectations.
We have committed to further actions on
our flood resilience program, divestment,
disengagement and dialogue around
thermal coal and reduction of our own carbon
footprint. We have also recommitted to
our responsible investment program, where
we will be increasing our impact investments
to USD 5 billion. And in 2017, Zurich was
extremely proud to be one of only six
companies worldwide to achieve a prestigious
EDGE ‘Move’ certification – both in
Switzerland and Austria – for gender equality.<br />
<h3>Farewell and the future</h3>
My 12 years at this fantastic organization – of
which five years were as Chairman – draw
to a close. I am fully confident that Zurich will
succeed and thrive in the future. The everstronger
emphasis on the customer combined
with an entrepreneurial culture will be the
main ingredients for this success. The company
is showing the necessary adaptive attitude
to evolve in the fast changing environment in
which it operates.
The Board will propose to shareholders at
the Annual General Meeting to elect Michel
Liès as my successor. I am very pleased with
the choice of Michel and am convinced he would
be an excellent chairman.
I would like to thank all stakeholders for the
support they have extended to me over the
last 12 years. A special word of thanks to all of
our approximately 53,000 employees
worldwide for their relentless commitment
to Zurich.
It was an honor to serve you all.
