       <p style="font-size:18px">Recently I bought one ULIP policy from Safe Secure Insurance. I felt customer service is good, all the process was very quick and hassle free because everything was online, even my premium payment was paid by Internet banking.

Safe secure Life's claim settlement ratio is also good as per my knowledge and market research.

There are lot of Plans to fulfill the needs at each and every stage of our life. I was looking for Investment plan so I choose it, and one thing I like the most is I have the flexibility in paying premiums like monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and annually.

Staff is very kind and helpful. Thats what I experienced.
